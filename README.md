# epc_wood_fuel_mapping_shiny_app
This repository contains the data and code to produce a Shiny app mapping the geographic concentration and prevalence of wood fuel heat sources across England and Wales. The project uses a mixture of Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) and Census data.

The app is available to use on the Posit Connect Cloud: https://connect.posit.cloud/calum-kennedy-98/content/01929a2e-8b0d-f70b-9aa3-c08ebf1f68e6
